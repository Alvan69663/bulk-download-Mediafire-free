Dependencies:
	python3
	requests

Running on GNU/Linux:
	1. Using your package manager download all of the dependencies
	2. Go to the directory containing mfdl.py
	3. Run chmod +x mfdl.py
	4. Use according to the guide below

Running on Windows:
	1. Download and install python3 from their site
	2. Install all of the dependencies using pip (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-requests-in-python-for-windows-linux-mac/)
	3. Open the command line
	4. Go to the directory containing mfdl.py
	5. Use according to the guide below
	6. I have no idea if ansi escape codes work on windows, so the output might be kinda fucked

How to use:
	1. Run mfdl.py OUTPUT_DIR URL_LIST [URL_LIST]
	2. For a list of optional arguments check out mfdl.py --help
	3. mf-dl will then start downloading all of the links from URL_LIST to OUTPUT_DIR

Directory structure:
	File: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/FILENAME
	File metadata: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.info.json
	Folder metadata: xxxxxxxxxxxxx.info.json
	Avatars: avatars/*
	File keys are always 11, 15 or 31 characters long and folder keys are 13 or 19 characters long.
	Folder metadata files contain references to file keys to avoid downloading the same file in a directory
	and as a stand alone file.
	Navigating through folders is a bit of a pain in the ass atm but I plan on making a tool to browse
	saved archives

analyze.py
	Use this to find links
	
analyze_mediafire.py
	Use this to find mediafire links

mfdl.py
	Use this to find mediafire links and download them. mfdl.py and all of the tools above don't have to have a clean
	list. You can just feed it a lot of text and it will find URLs in it.

web_crawler.py
	Use this to search for mediafire links on websites. For more info run ./web_crawler.py --help

tests/*
	This directory contains tests to test if this tool works

Using as a library:
	Just import a .py file you want to use, the code isn't that complicated and names are pretty self explanatory.
